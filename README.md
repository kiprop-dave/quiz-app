# Quizzical :thinking:

This is my final solo project for [Bob Ziroll's React course on Scrimba.](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) It is a web app that allows the user to choose the category, difficulty and type of questions. It fetches the questions from the [Open Trivia Database Api](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and allows the user to pick the answers. It finally gives them their score and shows them the correct answers. Users can choose to play again afterwards.

## Built with ðŸ”§

- CSS
- [React js](https://reactjs.org/)
